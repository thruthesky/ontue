    <p class="fw-light fs-110  line-height-1-6em  mt-1 mb-5">
      Bookable time is an time interval to prevent a sudden booking by student.
      The input unit is minutes.
      If you put numbre 1 in bookable time, it means, student cannot book(reserve) your schedule that would begin in 1 minutes.
      Teachers who wants to be offline often should put 60 or more minutes.
      But those teacher who put longer bookable time gets less booking because their schedule may not appear on 'immediate booking' menu.

      <li>We don't consider a teacher as a good who teaches very well.</li>
      <li>
        We consider a teacher as a good teacher * If he has a good internet, headset, clam space ( no one and nothing interrupts.
        ) * If he speak very slow and smiles all the time. Most of all, who have a very good relationship with students.
        that's what we say good teacher or best teacher.

    <h2 class="fs-2rem m-0 fw-light border d-inline-block border-dodgerblue rounded-2 dodgerblue p-2"  ion-text color="blue">THE FIRST CLASS</h2>
    <ul class="fw-light fs-110  line-height-1-6em mt-1 mb-5">
        <li>The first class may be or may NOT be a free class.</li>
        <li>When it is a free class, it means student is new to our service and the student is giving a trial</li>
        <li>NOT only our system but also How the teacher is.</li>
        <li>It is a big chance for you to have a new student</li>
        <li>when you have a free class</li>
        <li>since free class means that the student has not decided yet to study with which teacher.</li>
        <li>You must be very careful to win this session.</li>
        <li>Smile. Speak Slowly. And you will win.</li>

    </ul>


    <h2 class="fs-2rem m-0 fw-light border d-inline-block border-dodgerblue rounded-2 dodgerblue p-2"  ion-text color="blue">RULES ON CONDUCTING A SESSION</h2>
    <ul  class="fw-light fs-110  line-height-1-6em mt-1 mb-5">
      <li class="mt-3">
        Teacher must add the student's kakao as his friend and must be able to communicate before class time. If the teacher did
        not contact with the student, the teacher must cancel the session.

      </li>

      <li class="mt-3">
        Do not send book in class time. Students are using smart phones. It is extremly difficult to open a book while doing video
        chat. If teacher asks the receive books, student will go in panic. So, it is bad idea sending books in class time.
        Teacher must send books before class time or after class time. Teacher will know if student is using smart phone
        or computer by watching their video.
      </li>

      <li class="mt-3">
        Winning Point!
        <br> It is proven that if a teacher smile all the time and speak very slowly, the teacher will win on online video education.

      </li>

      <li class="mt-3">
        Communication. What we are doing is communication after all. Teaching and learning comes after the teacher and student build
        a good relationship. Try to communicate with your students. The first class which may be a free class with a student
        is very important give a good impression and you are a good communicator and you can have a good relationship.

      </li>

      <li class="mt-3">

        Student cannot open the book. Teacher must send the book before class time. It is better that teacher send book(s) to the
        student for 1 month. Teacher must know student is using Mobile or Desktop. If student is using Mobile, then teacher
        must ask the student to read the book before the class time since the student could not open the book. If student
        is using Desktop, then the teacher may ask the student to open the book.

      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="fs-2rem m-0 fw-light border d-inline-block border-dodgerblue rounded-2 dodgerblue p-2"  ion-text color="blue">GRADING SYSTEM</h2>
    <ul  class="fw-light fs-110  line-height-1-6em mt-1 mb-5">
      <li class="mt-3">
        Good teacher will have grade 1. Again, as we explain above, good teacher is who has good internet, good environment, good
        devices. We believe all teachers has some level of good english teaching skills. So, having only good english teaching
        skill does not help to earn grade 1.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        Grade 2. Again, Having good english teaching skill only does not help to earn grade 2. We will give grade 2 to those teachers
        whom we see he/she is a capable of wining student's heart. Communication comes first and Teaching comes at last.
        English teaching is a communication after all. We will observe your perfomance based on your communication skills.
        You will need a good personality.
      </li>

      <li class="mt-3">
        Grade 3. Teachers who are always sought after students. Teachers who always win when they meet new students.
