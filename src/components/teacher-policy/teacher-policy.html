      </li>

      <li>
        Do not send book in class time.
        Students are using smart phones. It is extremly difficult to open a book while doing video chat.
        If teacher asks the receive books, student will go in panic.

        So, it is bad idea sending books in class time.
        Teacher must send books before class time or after class time.
        
        Teacher will know if student is using smart phone or computer by watching their video.

      <li>
        Communication.
        What we are doing is communication after all. Teaching and learning comes after the teacher and student build a good relationship.
